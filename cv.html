                                Your resume should be no longer than 1–2 pages. Keep it to
                                1 page if you have less than 8 years of professional work
                                experience. If you have more, you might consider using 2
                                pages.

                                Include a skills section – it’s incredibly important. This
                                step will prove highly valuable if the company uses ATS
                                (applicant tracking system).

                                convert this file to pdf in google docs by going to File,
                                select Download, and then pdf.

                                Write 2–5 bullet points for each position, depending on
                                the duration and relevance of the position. Keep sections
                                that are less relevant to the job you’re applying to
                                short.

                                Your most recent position should have the most bullet
                                points, as long as the position is relevant to the one
                                you’re applying for.

                                It’s not enough to describe what you have done or your
                                areas of responsibility, you need to quantify the impact
                                of your work. Recruiters scan resumes for numbers, so
                                quantify as much as you can.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            <li>
                                Or you could mention the increase in company revenue of
                                xx% that your work contributed to.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2 lines.
                                No recruiter will read bullet points that are as long as
                                paragraphs.

                                Carefully review your resume several times to eliminate
                                any typos. Additionally, consider having someone else
                                proofread it to prevent sending an imperfect resume.

                                Be consistent with grammar. Generally, resumes should be
                                written in the past tense. The exception is if you’re
                                describing your current position with ongoing
                                responsibilities.
